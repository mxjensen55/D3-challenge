                <p>Below is a visualization compiled using 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. Although it may be a little dated, it provides a good snapshot of the state of healthcare in this country and how that correlates with poverty
                    levels and median income. </p>

                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty, Median Household Income, and Lack of Healthcare in the United States</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>According to the data that we obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, there is a strong correlation between poverty levels and lack of healthcare in this country.</p>

                    <p>At a time when healthcare is on the top of everyone's minds, this information feels particularly heartbreaking. In the midst of this global pandemic, people who fall below the poverty line have either lost their jobs or have been deemed
                        "essential", leaving them more vulnerable to contract COVID-19 and the subsequent medical bills that will inevitably accrue.</p>

                    <p>Right now, according to an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-ranks-27th-for-healthcare-and-education-2018-9">article</a> by Aria Bendix with <em>Business Insider</em>, "The US now ranks 27th in the world for its levels of
                        healthcare and education". As a country that was once a global leader on many fronts, this is frankly embarrassing. We are not protecting our people; we are not doing enough for our most vulnerable populations. How can we continue
                        to claim to be a global superpower when a large population of our society cannot afford to seek basic medical care? We must do better.
